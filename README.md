## Project description

Develop a console application in Java that allows users to manage a ToDo list. The application should allow users to add, delete, list, and mark (CRUD) tasks as completed. The development will be carried out without the use of object-oriented programming principles, that is, no classes or objects will be used. All logic will be handled using primitive data structures and functions.

List Tasks:
A list of all tasks will be displayed, indicating which are completed and which are not.
Mark Task as Complete:
